# Next Session TODO

## Polish / Assets
- [ ] Find better shoot VFX/SFX
- [ ] Find better missile mesh for projectiles
- [ ] Move actually-used assets from marketplace folders into dedicated Content/Assets folder (for cleaner git tracking)

## Bug Fixes
- [x] ~~Investigate why XP gems are so large - resize or use different mesh~~ (Fixed: Scale controlled via DataAsset/code defaults)
- [x] ~~Investigate why XP isn't being added to the player~~ (Fixed: XP collection and leveling working correctly)

## Features
- [ ] Add hit effects on enemies when they get hit
- [ ] Add debug health bars on enemies (at minimum for debugging)

## Completed
- [x] XP gem visual system with DataAsset + code defaults fallback
- [x] Emissive glowing gem material with per-tier colors and brightness
- [x] Git repo setup with .gitignore for large marketplace assets
